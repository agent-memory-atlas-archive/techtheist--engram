# Engram operator's guide — configuring a graph over HTTP

This is the manual for an assistant that has been asked to change how a
project's memory behaves. Everything the pane's Settings can do, the core's
HTTP API can do; the MCP tools deliberately cannot (they read and write
knowledge, never its shape). Read this once when a user asks for a change,
or once on a cold start when you review the settings with them.

## Ground rules

1. **Config is the user's.** Change it on their explicit ask or with their
   agreement after you proposed it. Never reshape an ontology, drop a field,
   wipe history, or swap a model on your own judgment.
2. **Read before you write.** `PUT /config` replaces the whole document:
   `GET /config`, edit the fields you mean to change, send it all back.
   A refusal is a teaching error — it says what is wrong; fix that, retry.
3. **Nothing is stranded.** A type that still has nodes, a verb that still
   has edges, and a field that still has values cannot be removed by a PUT.
   Use the rename routes to migrate, or retype first.
4. **Tell the user what changed**, in one sentence, after every write.
5. **After reshaping the ontology or fields**, reinstall the capture skill
   (`POST /skills/install`) so the assistant's own instructions match, and
   turn on the brief's ontology section so every fresh session learns the
   vocabulary (`brief.ontology.show = true`).

## Reaching the core

- Port: `.engram/daemon.json` in the repo (`port`), or the machine core's
  `~/.engram/daemon.json` (default `8787`). Base URL `http://127.0.0.1:<port>`.
  Loopback only, no auth.
- Project scoping: every graph route also exists as
  `/projects/<id-or-name>/<route>` — `GET /projects` lists them. Bare routes
  address the core's launch graph, which on the machine core is the home
  graph, so **always scope to the project** you mean.
- The pane shows the same settings under the gear menu; anything you change
  here is visible there immediately.

```sh
PORT=$(sed -n 's/.*"port"[: ]*\([0-9]*\).*/\1/p' .engram/daemon.json)
curl -s "http://127.0.0.1:${PORT}/projects/<name>/config"
```

## The config document (`GET /config`, `PUT /config`)

Top-level keys: `ontology`, `policy`, `brief`, `versioning`, `history`,
`fields`. Everything travels with the graph (export/import, migration).

### `ontology` — types and verbs

- `preset`: provenance only (`engram`, `research`, `minimal`, `general`,
  `custom`).
- `types[]`: `name` (1–32 chars), `hue` (0–359, the one color input),
  `thought` (the teaching line `describe_ontology` shows), `durability`
  (`stable` | `episodic` | `volatile`, the default for new nodes),
  `roles` {`worklist` (open/resolved lifecycle, never decays while open),
  `anchor` (code-subject node carrying `code_refs`), `rank_prior` (0–0.5,
  ranking only), `highlight`, `versioned` (stamped with the working
  version), `tombstone` (deletion marker; sits out the conflict scan)},
  `brief` {`show`, `cap`, `excerpt`} — this type's canon section in the brief.
- `verbs[]`: `name` (lowercase, hyphen-joined so "from verb to" reads as a
  sentence), `reads_as` (a worked example), `roles` {`supersession`,
  `contradiction`, `reason`, `answer`, `dependency`}. Exactly one verb must
  carry `supersession` and exactly one `contradiction` — these are the two
  edges that make the graph active. Move the role, never remove it.
- **Add a type or verb**: append to the array and PUT. **Rename**:
  `POST /config/rename-type {"from","to"}` / `POST /config/rename-verb`
  bulk-retype stored rows — a PUT with a changed name is refused as a drop.
  **Remove**: only when nothing uses it.
- **Apply a preset**: `GET /config/presets` returns `[{id, name,
  description, config}]`; PUT the chosen `config` (it replaces types, verbs,
  policy and brief together; on a graph with nodes it lands only when the
  type names line up, or after you retyped).

### `fields[]` — custom fields on notes

Each: `name` (lowercase snake_case, ≤32 chars, never a built-in node key),
`label`, `kind` (`text` | `number` | `bool` | `date` | `enum` | `url`),
`values` (the vocabulary when `kind` is `enum`), `required` (writes of
applicable types that omit it are refused), `applies_to` (type names; empty =
all), `indexed` (the value joins search — TepinDB graphs only),
`show_in_brief`. A `date` field is also a search clock (`date_field` on
search). Rename with `POST /config/rename-field {"from","to"}` — every stored
value moves. Assistants then pass `"fields": {"name": value}` on
`add_note`/`update_node`; `describe_ontology` lists the roster.

### `brief` — what the session-start digest contains

`total_chars` (budget, ~4 chars per token), `tags` {show, cap}, `conflicts`
{show; uncapped}, `suspects` {show, cap}, `recent` {show, cap, excerpt},
`open` {show, cap, excerpt}, `handoff` {show, cap, excerpt} (notes tagged
`handoff` get guaranteed first placement), `home_reserve` (chars kept for the
home-graph section), `ontology` {show} — **teach this graph's types, verbs
and custom fields at the top of every brief**. Off in the shipped preset
because the skill already teaches the default ontology; turn it on for any
customized ontology or when custom fields exist.

### `history` — session recording

`enabled` (master switch, **off by default**; turning it on is a user
decision: the harvester reads coding-assistant transcripts on this machine
and seals them with a key in the OS keystore — a keychain prompt on macOS),
`harnesses` {`claude_code`, `codex`, `gemini`, `opencode`, `kilo`,
`antigravity`, `bob`: per-harness on/off}, `exclude_paths` (absolute paths
never read), `search_fallthrough` (may history answer when curated memory is
silent), `recency_collapse` (0–1 cosine at which `order: "recent"` folds an
older restatement under a newer one). Status: `GET /history` → `{enabled,
open, search_fallthrough, stats}`. `DELETE /history` wipes the recording —
user-only, never call it unless the user asked for exactly that.

### `versioning` — the working version stamp

`enabled` turns tracking on; the current value is `GET /version` and
`PUT /version {"version": "0.9.8"}` (`null` clears). The `set_version` MCP
tool does the same and enables tracking on first use. Types with
`roles.versioned = false` (Principle, Anchor in the shipped set) are exempt.

### `policy` — trust, decay, and retrieval knobs

Trust: `trust_created`, `trust_confirmed`, `trust_approved`,
`trust_approved_floor`, `trust_floor`, `stale_trust`; windows in days:
`episodic_window_days`, `volatile_window_days`, `approved_window_days`,
`decay_ttl_days` (days below stale before the decay pass archives a
provisional node). Write-time judgment: `duplicate_similarity`,
`conflict_suspect_similarity`, `conflict_nli_gate` (`null` = off),
`warn_similarity`, `nli_sweep_min_confidence`,
`claim_contradiction_min_confidence`. Retrieval: `keyword_weight` (BM25 share
of relevance), `semantic_floor`, `search_min_score`, `search_relative_cut`,
`window_overfetch`, `rerank_trust_weight`, `rerank_vote_k` (`null` = the
reranker has the final word), `rerank_full_note`, `delivery_floor`,
`weak_evidence_top`, `knee_cliff` (`null` = off; **`0` is the harshest trim,
not off** — the config refuses it), `weak_line_quantile`,
`weak_line_probes`, `session_diversity_demote` (`0` = off), `auto_tune`
(let a mature graph refit its own conflict floor and weak line).

Caveats to say out loud: the defaults were measured on the eval bench and
absolute thresholds do not transfer between graphs of a different register;
change one knob at a time, on a stated reason, and prefer the pane's
plain-word rendering when the user wants to understand a number. The
similarity thresholds were calibrated on the default embedding model.

## Machine-level settings (the core, not one graph)

- `GET /settings` / `POST /settings {"default_agent_project": "<name|id|home>"}`
  — which project a session binds when its client gives no folder signal
  (`null`/`"home"` clears). Future sessions only.
- `GET /encryption` / `POST /encryption {"target": "graph"|"history",
  "enabled": true|false}` — at-rest sealing per store kind (graph off by
  default, history on). The POST starts a migration of the current project's
  store; poll the GET for `job` progress; other projects converge when next
  opened. Ask before flipping the graph switch: exports stay plaintext, and
  the key lives in the OS keystore.
- `GET /models` / `POST /models {"role": "embedding"|"reranker"|"nli",
  "preset": "<name>"}` or `{"role", "custom": {"name", "base_url",
  "model_file", "dim", "pooling"}}` — the GET lists roles, current
  selections and preset names. Reranker and NLI swaps apply instantly; an
  **embedding swap re-embeds every open graph and the call blocks until it
  is done** (minutes on a large graph). Warn the user, and that duplicate /
  conflict thresholds were calibrated on the default embedder.
- `GET /projects` / `POST /projects {"path": "/abs/repo"}` /
  `DELETE /projects/{id}` — the registry; a repo also registers itself when
  `engram-alpha serve` runs inside it. Home and `/` are never project roots.

## Teaching surfaces

- `POST /skills/install {"variant": "relaxed"|"normal"|"aggressive"}`
  regenerates the capture skill in the repo from the live ontology (the
  canonical text when the graph runs the shipped set). Do it after every
  ontology or field change.
- The `describe_ontology` MCP tool renders the live vocabulary on demand;
  `brief.ontology.show` puts the same text at the top of every brief.

## Maintenance the user may ask for

`POST /conflicts/scan` (queue suspected conflicts now), `GET /conflicts/suspects`,
`POST /decay?dry_run=true` (preview what the decay pass would archive; omit
`dry_run` to run it), `GET /drift` (nodes whose `code_refs` no longer
resolve), `POST /audit/conflicts`, `POST /audit/duplicates`,
`POST /audit/answered`, `POST /audit/promotions`, `POST /audit/stale`
(checkup sweeps — nominations, never verdicts), `GET /export` / `POST /import`
(the whole graph as JSON, config included). Hard delete and pinning stay
pane-only.

## Before a digest: review the settings with the user

An ingestion writes dozens of nodes into whatever ontology the graph has, so
the shape should be chosen first. `GET /config`, then ask: does the shipped
9-type set (decisions, principles, cautions, problems, resolutions,
insights, intents, anchors, tombstones) fit this project, or would a preset
(`research`, `minimal`, `general`) or a custom set fit better? Would custom
fields carry something the user keeps repeating in bodies — an owner, a
component, a ticket, an effective date? If anything is customized, set
`brief.ontology.show = true` and reinstall the skill before the first write,
so every session that follows speaks the graph's language.
